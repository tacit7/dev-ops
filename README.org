* AWS
** Installing CLI
[[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-macos.html#install-bundle-macos][AWS CLI install instructions]]

You can install python 3, but you have to specify the path when installing
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
brew install python
PY_PATH=$(which python3)

curl "https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-cli/awscli-bundle.zip" -o "awscli-bundle.zip"
unzip awscli-bundle.zip
sudo ./awscli-bundle/install -i /usr/local/aws -b /usr/local/bin/aws

sudo $PY_PATH awscli-bundle/install -i /usr/local/aws -b /usr/local/bin/aws
#+END_SRC


Or if you already are using pip:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
pip3 install awscli --upgrade --user
#+END_SRC
If you use pip you will need to add the aws path to your $PATH
That should be something like:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$HOME/Library/Python/<python-version>/bin
#+END_SRC

Then configure the cli using your creds.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
aws configure
#+END_SRC

** SQS

Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a highly scalable distributed message
queuing service provided by Amazon.

There are two types of queues

- Standard :: Nearly unlimited throughput with best-effort ordering. At-least-once delivery (You might get same message twice.)

- FIFO :: Limited number of transactions per second (TPS). See Amazon SQS FIFO developer
guide for more information on limits. Order in which messages are sent/received
is strictly preserved Exactly-once delivery

** Kinesis


#+BEGIN_SRC plantuml :file ./img/kinesis.png
package "Amazon Kinesis"{
[Kinesis Streams] as Streams
[Kinesis Analytics] as Analytics
[Kinesis Firehose] as Firehose
}
[Click Streams] --> Streams
[IoT Devices] --> Streams
[Metrics/logs] --> Streams

Streams --> Analytics
Analytics --> Firehose

Firehose --> [Amazon S3 Bucket]
Firehose --> [Amazon Redshift]

[[https://github.com/tacit7/dev-ops/blob/master/img/kinesis.png]] 


*** Streams
- Divided into partitions
- Can retain data from one day up to seven days
- Can have multiple consumers
- Real-time processing
- Immutable data

*** Shards
- a stream has many shards
- 1 MB/s or 1000 messages at write *per shard*
- 2 MB/s at *read per shard*
- Billed per shard 
- Users can have unlimited shards
- Messages are ordered per shard
* Puppet vs. Chef vs. Ansible vs. SaltStack

** Puppet

- Written in Ruby
- Ruby DSL with usage of ERB
- Declarative
- Master/agent



*** Pros

- good reporting tools
- good web ui
- supports multiple OSs
- good for large enterprises
- A lot of CLI

*** Cons

- Difficult for non-rubyists
- A lot of CLI
- May be hard to scale?
- Multiple masters can get complicated
- Remote execution can be complicated
- No push


** Chef

- Made by [[https://www.chef.io/][OpsCode]]
- Client-server architecture
- Ruby DSL



*** Pros

- Flexible
- Good documentation
- Stable
- Reporting

*** Cons

- Steep learning curve
- Initial setup be complicated
- No push
- Docs can be hard to follow


** Ansible

- Python based
- Imperative
- Multiple push

*** Pros

- Easy to pick up
- Can scale rapidly
- Easy installation
- Sequential execution order
- Push and pull models
- Faster than master-agent model
- No master
- Probably better for personal projects

*** Cons

- Focused on orchestration
- No master
- Might be hard to scale with ssh
- Needs python installed on server
- Not as mature as others

** SaltStack


*** Pros:

- Can scale ?
- Easy to pick up
- Python based
- Probably better for usage in industry

*** Cons

- installation can be difficult
- Docs can be hard to read
- No good UI
- Not good for non-linux systems
